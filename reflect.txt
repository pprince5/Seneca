1) No, i do not have previous programing experience and as a beginner C language and this course is a little complicated as, i have to remember commands
and there are errors for even a small mistake which are sometimes hard to find, but, ofcourse, i am sure that soon i will be quite good with this.

2) well, according to me, COmpilimg process of turning a C text file into an executable program is a organised way, it needs every character and sentence to be
in a proper syntax and proper text-case. You need to be very careful about what you are typing, because a single character or sign at a wrong 
place can ruin the whole code.

3) I hope to achieve a good amount of knowledge about C language. I expect myself to be a good programer in C language which will help me achieve
 my goal to become a back-end developer.
